A Trello tool that formats inputs into a Markdown description that is able to be inputted to a Trello card. Calculates hours estimated for a project based on E = (O + L + (4 * P)) / 6.

FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT:
  - separate olpu input for each person
  - separate olpu for each person in output
  - if no entry, do not output
  - copy to clipboard
